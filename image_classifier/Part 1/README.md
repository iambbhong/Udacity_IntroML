## Notes

*Project_Image_Classifier_Project_results_localCPU.ipynb* and *Project_Image_Classifier_Project_results_localCPU.html* were results done from local CPU computer. They are clean versions without any warnings

*Project_Image_Classifier_Project_results_WorkSpaceGPU.ipynb* and *Project_Image_Classifier_Project_results_WOrkSpaceGPU.html* were results done from Workspace with GPU enabled. There are a lot of warnings, which can even be suppressed by `tf.get_logger().setLevel('WARNING')` and `@tf.autograph.experimental.do_not_convert`
